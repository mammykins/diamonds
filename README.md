# diamonds
## Using a 2008 dataset we use linear regression to model diamond price by 9 predictors.  

How do we avoid getting hustled when buying a diamond? We use up-to-date prices (fail) to build a predictive model that uses key variables of the diamond to predict its price. We can simplify our model by including the most informative variables.  

Join me in a journey where I plot all the variable interactions using ggpairs and then go on to use linear regression to model the price explaining 97% of the variation using a few predictors.  

N.B. Search for diamonds on r-bloggers and you'll find something similar.
